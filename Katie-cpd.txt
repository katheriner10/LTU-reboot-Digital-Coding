Reflection

In today's session I learnt that web development industry is a rewarding, lucrative and creative industry to get into.

I also introduced myself to a class of strangers. 

1.2 - 11/11/2020

I learnt how the internet and browsing on the web works, and the definitions of many different terms. We downloaded and installed GitHub and Visual Studio Code, and learnt about what these software can be used for. 

I found it particularly interesting to learn the details of how servers work and what purpose they have.
